# Photographical Display üì∏

A personal photography portfolio showcasing my travel photography from various cities and countries around the world.

## Overview

Inspired by this [Award Winning Animation With Only 20 Lines Of CSS?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkADl0HubMY&t=169s&pp=ygUfYXdhcmQgd2lubmluZyBjc3MgY29kZSAyMCBsaW5lcw%3D%3D) as a base for this repository, I have created this photographical display to showcase the pictures I take. This is not a particularly complex project since the main goal is to show my pictures, but it is also to do some satisfying transitions and effects with base CSS.

## Next To-Dos
-  Text that appears centered per photo upon hover

-  A nice transition of the clicked cover image expanding and fade at the same time into that category of images
